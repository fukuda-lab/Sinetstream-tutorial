# Building a server

In this section, we will build a server to visualize the sensor readings sent from the Raspberry Pi, including a graph display. The construction procedure and the directory containing the materials are shown below.

* Grafana
  * [Kafka-Grafana/README.en.md](Kafka-Grafana/README.en.md)
* Zabbix
  * [Kafka-Zabbix/README.en.md](Kafka-Zabbix/README.en.md)

If you want to build only Kafka broker without building visualization parts such as Grafana, Zabbix, etc., you can use `../../option/Server/` for instructions.

* Kafka broker
  * [Kafka/README](../../option/Server/Kafka/README.en.md)

> All procedures include instructions for building the Kafka broker; the building part of the Kafka broker is identical.
