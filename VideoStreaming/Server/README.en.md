# Building a Server

Here are examples of GPU processing using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). The construction procedure and the directory containing the materials are shown below.

* OpenPose
  * [Kafka-OpenPose/README_en.md](Kafka-OpenPose/README_en.md)
* YOLOv5
  * [Kafka-YOLO/README_en.md](Kafka-YOLO/README_en.md)


If you only want to build a Kafka broker without image processing such as OpenPose, YOLOv5, etc., you can use `../../option/Server/` for instructions.

* Kafka broker
  * [Kafka/README](../../option/Server/Kafka/README_en.md)

> The Kafka-OpenPose/ and Kafka-YOLO/ instructions also include instructions for building the Kafka broker.
